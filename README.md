## Team Guidelines

### 1. Setting Up the Project
- Clone the repository:  
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  ```
- Install dependencies:  
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Start the development server:  
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

### 2. Branching Strategy
- Always create a new branch for your tasks. Use the following naming convention:  
  ```
  <feature|bugfix|hotfix>/<short-description>
  ```
  Example: `feature/add-navbar`, `bugfix/fix-login-error`

- To create a new branch:  
  ```bash
  git checkout -b <branch-name>
  ```

### 3. Working on Tasks
- Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the `main` branch:  
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```
- Commit your changes with clear and descriptive messages:  
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Add feature: Implement navbar component"
  ```

### 4. Code Reviews and Merging
- Push your branch to the remote repository:  
  ```bash
  git push origin <branch-name>
  ```
- Create a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch.
- Assign at least one team member to review your PR.
- Address any feedback and ensure all checks pass before merging.

### 5. Best Practices
- Follow the project's coding standards and linting rules.
- Write clear and concise comments for complex code.
- Test your changes thoroughly before creating a PR.
- Avoid committing sensitive information or large files.

### 6. Communication
- Use the project management tool (e.g., Trello, Jira) to track your tasks.
- Update the team regularly on your progress during stand-ups or via the designated communication channel.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure smooth collaboration and maintain high-quality code throughout the project.
